ScanCarnet v8 - UI polish
- Prettier help button (pill) on splash
- Profile page visually improved with gradient header and nicer inputs
- Functionality unchanged (Start works, CSV/PDF export, cycles, sessions)
- Includes sw.js and manifest to ensure old service workers are replaced

Deployment:
Replace your repo contents with these files, commit and push to main branch.
If you still see old behaviour, clear site data / unregister service worker in browser.
